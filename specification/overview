I. PREFACE
  I think it's import that I start this document with a brief explanation of some
  sorts. First and foremeost: I have no business writing this document. I am an
  experienced hobbyist programmer and basically have no idea what I'm doing here.
  If this language ever picks up steam (which I sincerely doubyt), maybe I could
  get this peer reviewed and fix the flaws in my language design and terminology.
  The sole reason that this project exists is I had some ideas one day that
  required a computer to be able to interpret any sequencce of randomly generated
  bytes as a valid program and nothing to my knowledge existed that could do
  that, so I decided to write my own language that could. From here on out, I will
  try to keep things as professional as possible (within the constraints of my
  abilities).

III. LANGUAGE OVERVIEW
  High Level Binaray (HLB) is a high-level programming language that is interpreted
  at a binary level, meaning that the entire program is expressed in binary. Furthermore,
  any suitably long string of binary can be considered a valid HLB program and therefore
  run to produce a result.
  
  It is important to note that HLB does NOT interpret input as bytes. The program is
  read in one bit at a time and processed in groups of varying sizes depending on the
  context.
