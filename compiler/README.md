# Advanced Assembly Compiler

Advanced Assembly consists of a series of mnemonics and series of bits.
Therefore, the most basic compiler simply needs to replace the mnemonics and
convert the bit strings expressed in ascii to strings of actual bits. This most
basic compiler will be the first implemented. However, there are many more
advanced features that will be added to the compiler as time progresses to make
writing Advanced Assembly code more feasible. As such, there are going to be
several compilers in this directory each with varying features. Refer to each
compiler for a description of what features it contains.
