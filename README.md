# High Level Binary (HLB)

High Level Binaray (HLB) is a flexible high-level programming language that supports both the functional
and object oriented paradigms. What makes HLB unique is that the entire programming language is written
in pure binary and that every possible sequence of binary longer than a certain length [this length will
be determined once the specification is written] is a valid program that can be executed to produce some
sort of output. HLB code is run in an interpreter [that will most likely be written in Python]. The purpose
of HLB is twofold: to be able to concisely express high-level programming concepts in raw binary and to
be able to interpret and run any sequence of binary to easily facilitate randomly generated programs.
